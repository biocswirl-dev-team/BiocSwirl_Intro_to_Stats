- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to the correlation lesson!

- Class: text
  Output: The previous lesson covered how to use the `ggplot2` package to visualize data and gather further insights on the data. This lesson plan would cover various statistical approaches that can allow us to better interpret our data.
  
- Class: text
  Output: This tutorial will cover the use of two statistical methods: correlation and two-sample tests. These are inescapable in the life sciences. You will learn what each method can achieve, what information they can provide, how to interpret the outcome, and how to visualize the results.

- Class: text
  Output: First we shall use the gene expression dataset as part of this lesson plan. The data has been adapted from Chan, Chang S., et al. Nature communications 9.1 (2018): 1-10. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-06498-2

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "First, we will start off by loading the metadata file. metadata <- read.csv("data/pannets_metadata.csv")'"
  CorrectAnswer: metadata <- read.csv("data/pannets_metadata.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'metadata <- read.csv("data/pannets_metadata.csv")')
  Hint: Try copying the read.csv code from the text above.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Next, we shall load the gene expression dataset. rnaseq <- read_csv("data/pannets_expr_rnaseq.csv.gz")'"
  CorrectAnswer: rnaseq <- read_csv("data/pannets_expr_rnaseq.csv.gz")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'rnaseq <- read_csv("data/pannets_expr_rnaseq.csv.gz")')
  Hint: Try copying the read.csv code from the text above.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: How do we display the first few rows of the rnaseq gene expression dataset?
  AnswerChoices: summary(rnaseq);tail(rnaseq);head(rnaseq);dim(rnaseq)
  CorrectAnswer: head(rnaseq)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'head(rnaseq)')
  Hint: Check the output of 'head(rnaseq)'
